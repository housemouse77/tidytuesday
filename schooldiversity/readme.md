#tidytuesday on school diversity

I learned about #alluvium plots recently and wanted to create one using the student diversity data. 

Schools became more diverse, yet "white majority" schools are still there, mostly large suburban schools.

The data is from https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-09-24
