This week's #tidytuesday project is related to powerlifting. The data is from Open Powerlifting. 

The dataset was obtained from https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-08.

I focused my analysis on how much relative weight do the champions lift e.g. their best weight per kg of their own bodyweight.

I split the dataset into Champions (those in places 1-3) and Non-champions (everyone else) as well as males / females.

I  display violin plots of the distributions by age groups for the two subsets (champions and non-champions).

The repository contains the R code for visualization and the resulting chart.
